                    During my first month at BAE Systems, I volunteered to aid the early careers team based in Glasgow, Scotland with arranging the Graduate Immersion Induction for the September Intake.
                    I was tasked to liase with the new starters to arrange flights and hotel stays for the time they would spend in Glasgow for the Induction. Along with arranging their flights, I would also
                    join them in travelling up to Glasgow to assist with the actual event itself. I acted as the first point of contact to eight new graduate starters for around one month and a half before they joined the business.
                    Once I was in Glasgow, I then helped the early careers team in conducting the 3-day long in-person induction. <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6972555268836446208/" target="_blank">See Here.</a>

                    As a committed individual, taking pride in my 100% commitment to any task or interest. 
                    An example of this is that I have been raising money for charity from a very young age. In 2016, after 2 years of training, 
                    I cycled from Land’s End in Cornwall to John o’ Groats in Scotland, completing a total of 999 miles in 12 consecutive days. 
                    I successfully raised £7300 for three individual charities, Autoimmune Alopecia Research UK, Birmingham Children’s Hospital and Sandwell Young Carers. 
                    In addition, I set up a blog for the whole event and for the training attracting interest from BBC Midlands Today. 
                    There have been many other cycle events that I have completed, such as including Birmingham Bikeathon for Leukaemia and 
                    cycling for men’s cancer when I was 6 years of age, and I have raised money with family in other events, for example, Macmillan Cancer Support.
