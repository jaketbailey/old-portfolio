          <h2> About Me </h2>
            <p>
              I am an outgoing and self-motivated student and employee. I have recently completed my industrial placement as a Combat Systems Software Engineer at BAE Systems Maritime Naval Ships working with technologies such as Vue.js, MATLAB, Django and React.js.
            </p>
            <p>
              In September, I be heading back to university to continue studying for my 4th (Final-Year) of my BSc(Hons) in Software Engineering at the University of Portsmouth.
            </p>
            <p>
              Outside of work, I redeveloped my Portfolio site using Next.js, Bootstrap and Express.js, further developing my current skills within web development.
            </p>
            <p>
              In addition one of my interests is road cycling which helped me raise Â£7,300 for 3 local charities by cycling Lands End to John O'Groats in 12 days in 2016.
